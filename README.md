## Problem Statement

Customer segmentation divides a market into discrete customer groups with similar characteristics. Businesses can leverage this data to outperform competitors by offering uniquely appealing products and services. 

This project aims to:
1. Analyze demographic, geographical, psychographic, and behavioral data.
2. Segment customers based on their purchasing capabilities using their transaction history.

### Benefits of Customer Segmentation:
- Optimize product pricing.
- Develop targeted marketing campaigns.
- Enhance distribution strategies.
- Prioritize product development efforts.
